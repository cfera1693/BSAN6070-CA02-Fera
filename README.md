# CA02: Spam eMail Detection using Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm

Apply Naive Bayes model to predict the category of a series of emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

1) A computer with Wi-Fi connection.
2) A web browser (any of your preference). 
2) An account on Google-Drive.
3) Basic knowledgement in using computers, Internet and Google Colaboratory. 

### Steps

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Say what the step will be

1) Download the files attached to this repository. 
2) Open your web browser and navigate to your Google Drive account. 
3) In your Google Drive account, click in New -> More.. -> Google Colaboratory.
4) In your new Google Colab file, go to File -> Open notebook.. 
5) Upload the data file attached to this repository called "CA02 - Carla Fera.ipynb".
The code should appear in the screen, with the corresponding outputs. This means that you don't need to run it.

In case you want to run the code yourself follow steps bellow. 

6) Create a path inside your Google Drive that looks like the following: 
                
'/MSBA_Colab_2020/ML_Algorithms/CA02/Data'
   
This means that you need to create, first a folder called "MSBA_Colab_2020". Then, inside that folder, one that's called "ML_Algorithms", and so on; until you finish with the train-emails and test-emails, which is the "Data".You will use these path in your code. One for the train set and another one for the test set. They are already written on the code. This step is IMPORTANT in order to be able to run the code without errors. 

7) In the left side of the Google Colab, in the File section, click on 'Mount Drive'. 
8) Once the Drive is mounted, click on Runtime -> Run all. 

Thank you!
